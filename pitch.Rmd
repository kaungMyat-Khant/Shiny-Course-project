## About this App
This app can be used to predict the price of a diamond based on its color, clarity and mass in carat.
You can also specify which cut of the diamond you want to use in predicting the price.
```{r data, include = TRUE}
diamonds %>% select(cut, color, clarity, carat, price) %>% slice_head(n= 5) %>% 
    kable()
```
